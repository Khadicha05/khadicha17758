        <section class="story">
            <p>I started my adventure in the main folder and found a few files, but the real fun began when I went into the <span class="highlight">EntranceGrounds</span> folder. From there, I explored the <span class="highlight">SidePath</span> and <span class="highlight">OuterWalls</span>.</p>
            
            <p>In the <span class="highlight">StorageRoom</span>, I found a file called <span class="highlight">StoneKey.key</span>, which looked important. I tried to use it right away by typing its path, thinking it would work like a command, but nothing happened. That part was tricky—it took me a while to understand that I needed to use the <code>move</code> command to move the file to the <span class="highlight">InnerKeep</span>. Figuring out the right way to write that command wasn't easy, and I got stuck for a bit. But with some patience—and help from my friend Diyora—I finally got it to work.</p>
            
            <p>Once I moved the key, it glowed and opened a big locked door in the <span class="highlight">InnerKeep</span>, which led to a hidden place called the <span class="highlight">ForbiddenLibrary</span>. Inside, we found a cursed book. I couldn't delete it at first, but Diyora remembered a line from the <span class="highlight">OldRecords.tome</span> that said to use <code>attrib -elim</code> for cursed files. That command worked, and the book disappeared. When it did, a secret <span class="highlight">ReadingChamber</span> was revealed.</p>
            
            <p>In that chamber, I found a file called <span class="highlight">Treasure.txt</span>. It had a link to my teacher's website and showed that I had found the ASCII Chalice. That last step was the hardest—it took me some extra thinking and a bit of problem-solving to figure out where the treasure was. But in the end, I found it! This whole assignment felt like a computer-based treasure hunt. It was challenging, but also really fun and rewarding.</p>

            <h2>What This Assignment Really Was</h2>
            <p>A puzzle inside a story. A game hidden in homework. A riddle made of folders and files.</p>
            <p>I learned that every wrong path taught me something. That reading carefully matters. That asking a friend can change everything. And that sometimes, you have to think just a little bit deeper to find what's truly hidden.</p>
